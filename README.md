# Navigation-and-Guidance-Project

This project investigates the stability and control characteristics of the F104-A aircraft model.
Through longitudinal dynamics analysis, stability derivatives are determined and expressed in state
space form. Transfer functions for longitudinal are derived to examine the influence of stability
derivatives on eigenvalues and eigen vectors. An optimal feedback control law is designed using
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) techniques, ensuring closed-loop stability by tuning the gain
vector. A Kalman Filter is then implemented to estimate the true states, and its performance is
analyzed through simulated plots.
Furthermore, the project, focuses on a missile-target engagement scenario, where three distinct
guidance laws are designed and analyzed. Simulations of missile and target trajectories, along
with the corresponding guidance commands, are presented for each law. A comparative analysis
highlights the differences in performance and effectiveness of the guidance strategies. The study
integrates control and estimation techniques, offering insights into both aircraft dynamics and missile guidance systems.
